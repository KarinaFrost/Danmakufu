# Danmakufu
Here's where I'll dump my Danmakufu work and experiments.

Feel free to use, edit, modify these scripts, as I am just learning how to work the code to do exactly what I want, I do ask that if you use the unmodified code in an actual script, please leave credit, because it's a nice thing to do. You don't have to if you don't want to.

If there are any issues or if you have tips and strategies, please, let me know, it can only make my next script better.
