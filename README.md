# Danmakufu
Here's where I'll dump my Danmakufu work and experiments.

ALL SCRIPTS ARE WRITTEN USING PH3.

Feel free to use, edit, modify these scripts, as I am just learning how to work the code to do exactly what I want, I do ask that if you use the unmodified code in an actual script, please leave credit, because it's a nice thing to do. You don't have to if you don't want to.

If there are any issues or if you have tips and strategies, please, let me know, it can only make my next script better.

Unless stated, all scripts work with the default files for Danmakufu. If files are actually needed, I'll probably include them here, as well as a note in the script file itself directing you to the proper file. If I am not allowed to rehost a file, I will link you to a place you can get the script/images needed.

Thank you, Sparren, for the tutorials, as well as hopefully continued support and assistance with Danmakufu PH3.
